## Introduction

You can use AJAX to call the Random User Generator API and will receive a randomly generated user in return.

https://randomuser.me/api/

## Results

The API will provide you with a formatted object of your choice that you can parse and apply to your application.

JSON is the default format.

## Requesting Multiple Users

Random User Generator allows you to fetch up to 5,000 generated users in one request using the results parameter.

https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5000

## Specifying a gender

You can specify whether you would like to have only male or only female users generated by adding the gender parameter to your request. Valid values for the gender parameter are "male" or "female", or you may leave the parameter blank. Any other value will cause the service to return both male and female users.

https://randomuser.me/api/?gender=female

## Nationalities

You can request a different nationality of a randomuser.

Pictures won't be affected by this, but data such as location, cell/home phone, id, etc. will be more appropriate.

Currently, randomuser offers these nationalities:

AU, BR, CA, CH, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GB, IE, IR, NL, NZ, TR, US

https://randomuser.me/api/?nat=gb

Randomuser will return random nats by default. You can have some control with the nats that you'd like to have generated by specifying a comma seperated list:

https://randomuser.me/api/?nat=us,dk,fr,gb

## Including/Excluding fields

Sometimes, maybe you want some random names and not extraneous data such as location, phone, etc.
Using the inc and exc parameters, you can specify which fields to include or exclude respectively.

By specifying only the fields you want, the generator can save time by skipping CPU intensive fields like "login" for example.

These parameters accept the following values in a comma delimited list

gender
name
location
email
login
registered
dob
phone
cell
id
picture
nat
If you only wanted the names,genders,and nats of users:

https://randomuser.me/api/?inc=gender,name,nat

If you want everything except for login data:

https://randomuser.me/api/?exc=login
